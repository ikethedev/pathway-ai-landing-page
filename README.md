# Pathway AI ‚Äì Personalized Math Diagnostics for Every Learner

Pathway AI is an early-stage edtech product designed to close learning gaps by identifying foundational skill weaknesses and delivering personalized learning pathways. Built with React, TypeScript, and CSS Modules, this landing page introduces the vision and value of the platform and serves as the first step toward product validation and stakeholder engagement.

## ‚ú® Why Pathway AI?

In today‚Äôs classrooms, teachers are overwhelmed by the wide range of abilities. Students often lack key conceptual foundations and tools fail to address holistically.

Existing solutions like IXL, DeltaMath, and Edia provide partial answers, but few offer:

- Accurate, interpretable diagnostic data
- Actionable next steps for students and teachers
- Math content connected to real-world application
- Student motivation through relevant, low-stakes feedback

Pathway AI was built to prototype a solution that does all of the above.
